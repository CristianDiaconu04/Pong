<p> I created the famous arcade game pong in Java when starting to learn OOP for a 12th grade computer science assignment. I was given Game.java and GameObject.java as starter files. The Pong class is a child of the Game class and contains the basic game fields and functions such as score, ball size, paddle size, checking for ball collision, etc. The Ball and Paddle classes are children of the GameObject class and each contain functions for setting up the object, and their movement on the screen.</p>
